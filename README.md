# The Decoder Ring

Project Scenerio:
You're planning a surprise birthday party for a friend who loves escape rooms and puzzles.
What better way to practice your new coding skills than to build an application that will help you encode and decode all kinds of fun messages?

This project is designed to test my ability to build complex algorithms and to write unit tests with Mocha and Chai.
